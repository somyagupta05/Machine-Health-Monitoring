## Machine-Health-Monitoring-System 
The Machine Monitoring System is a powerful tool designed to track and analyze the real-time operational data of industrial machines, helping you to improve efficiency, reduce downtime, and ensure preventive maintenance. This system collects data from various sensors and devices connected to the machines, providing a centralized dashboard that displays key performance indicators (KPIs) and alerts for operationalÂ insights.

# Key Features of Machine-Health-Monitoring-System
 . Predictive Maintenance: Uses machine learning models to analyze historical data and predict potential failures, enabling proactive maintenance to avoid costly downtime.
 . Custom Alerts & Notifications: Configurable alerts for key parameters such as vibration levels, temperature thresholds, and performance drops, with notifications via email, SMS, or in-app alerts.

# Product Workflow
 1. Data Collection Setup:
    Manual Form Entry: Design a digital form for operators to manually enter data, capturing parameters relevant to machine health (e.g., temperature, RPM, vibration levels).
    Automated Sensor Integration: Install sensors to capture real-time data directly from the machine (e.g., temperature sensors, vibration sensors).
2.  Real-Time Data Analysis: Set up algorithms or rules to continuously analyze incoming data, identifying patterns that may indicate potential issues or impending failures.
3.  Automated Machine Control (Failure Response): Power Cutoff Mechanism-Integrate a control mechanism that can automatically shut down the machine if failure conditions are detected.
